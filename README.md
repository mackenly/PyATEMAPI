# PyATEMAPI
 Python ATEM REST API
 
 ðŸ›‘ **Do Not Use In Production, Still Needs More Testing** ðŸ›‘

## Purpose
To provide a web API for interfacing with ATEM Switchers. The API is designed to be as simple as possible and to be as flexible as possible.

Why build a web API for ATEM?

This API allows developers to interact with ATEM Switchers without having to write desktop code. Instead, developers can now interact with an ATEM through the browser using simple web APIs with Javascript.

## Roadmap / Features
- [x] Fully Documented in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19380446/UzQpvT1y)
- [x] Get tally data
- [x] Fade to black
- [x] Cut
- [x] Auto transition
- [x] Set preview
- [x] Set program
- [x] Ping switcher
- [x] Disconnect from switcher
- [ ] Connect to switcher
- [ ] Fully Test using real switcher (built using simulator)

## Usage
Clone PyATEMAPI to your machine by running:

```git clone https://github.com/mackenly/PyATEMAPI.git```

While in the directory of the project, run setup.py to start the server. Pass in as parameters the IP address of the ATEM Switcher and simple passphrase for basic authentication.

```python server.py 127.0.0.1 Password1```

After starting the server, you can use the web API to interact with the ATEM Switcher.

<br>**Testing**<br>
If you would like to test this API, you can use a tool called [PyATEMSim](https://github.com/jonknoll/pyAtemSim).
In the directory of the simulator simply run `python atem_server.py` and you will be able to interact with the ATEM Switcher's provided path and port via this API.

## Documentation
The API documentation is available through Postman at [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19380446/UzQpvT1y](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19380446/UzQpvT1y).
